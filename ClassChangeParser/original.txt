[toggler name="Hunter Pets" size=3 class="c3" closed=true toc=false]
In Battle for Azeroth, each Hunter pet family has a single specialization, any beast from that family will have that specialization and you won't be able to change it. Each specialization has unique abilities:

[b]Ferocity[/b]
[ul]
    [li][spell=264663] - You and your pet gain 3% Leech.[/li]
    [li][spell=264667] - Increases haste by 30% for all party and raid members for 40 sec. Allies receiving this effect will become Sated and unable to benefit from Primal Rage or similar effects again for 10 min.[/li]
[/ul]
[b]Tenacity[/b]
[ul]
    [li][spell=264662] - You and your pet gain 10% increased maximum health.[/li]
    [li][spell=264735] - Reduces all damage you and your pet take by 20% for 6 sec.[/li]
[/ul]
[b]Cunning[/b]
[ul]
    [li][spell=264656] - You and your pet gain 8% increased movement speed.[/li]
    [li][spell=53271] - Your pet removes all root and movement impairing effects from itself and its target, and grants immunity to all such effects for 4 sec.[/li]
[/ul]

Besides those exclusive abilities, all pets receive [spell=145626] and [spell=2649]. Each individual pet family also received changes, adding more abilities to families that lacked those. All families now have one basic attack and one special. Some have bonus abilities. We have tamed all different families on Alpha to test which specialization and abilities each family had and the results are in the table below.

Some notable changes are pets like [pet=37]s that have changed from Ferocity to Cunning. This change was likely because otherwise [pet=37]s would have access to a Combat Resurrection (from the family ability [spell=159956]) and Bloodlust/Heroism (from the specialization ability [spell=264667]). Also, the player-favorite family [pet=46] have been changed from Ferocity to Tenacity.
